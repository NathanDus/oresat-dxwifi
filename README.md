# oresat-dxwifi
OreSat subsystem for high speed data using WiFi between Earth and spacecraft 

It is the intent to use WiFi for high speed data for the science missions on OreSat. It also thought that the components would be mostly COTS, but that is not a requirement.

NB:  There are other DxWiFi materials on the PSAS GitHub repo, in particular:
   - A proposed WiFi [power amplifier design project](https://github.com/psas/dxwifi-pa)
   - The efforts of testing and using [WiFi with the PSAS rocket](https://github.com/psas/DxWiFi)
